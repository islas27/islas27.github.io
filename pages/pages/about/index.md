Hi! My name is Jonathan Islas. I recently graduated from college, with a BS in Software Engineering.

I like to focus mostly on web development using JS.

I also like a lot learning languages. I've been studying Japanese on and off for some years (time is always scarce), and I've also been to China to study Chinese back in 2011-2012.

Another hobby of mine is gaming. Guilty of being a Nintendo fanboy.
Give me some Mario something before any shooter or racing game (except Mario Kart :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: ).

Other topics I'm interested in are:
- Educational Software
- Language learning tools & software
- Data Mining & patterns research
- Games development

Please checkout my Github or Bitbucket accounts to see what I'm up to recently in coding projects.
