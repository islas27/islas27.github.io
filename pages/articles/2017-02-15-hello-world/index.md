My name is Jonathan, welcome to my personal blog.

Here you'll find the following:

1. Development information, mostly focused on web development
2. Information & experiences about learning languages (I study/studied Japanese & Chinese)
2. Maybe some personal issues
3. Maybe good news in my life
4. and probably rants, sometimes.

Feel at home!
